# Mechanical-workshop-system
This app was developed to help mechanical workshops to manage their business and to have all of the information needed to keep
customers happy.

It was main developed with C# and Windows Forms, also it uses some DevExpress components.

This application was developed in my software engineering specialization course only for study purpose, but after I've 
finished my course I had the chance to install it in some mechanical workshops.
